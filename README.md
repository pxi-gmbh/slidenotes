# slidenotes.io

*an agnostic web editor to turn text into responsive presentations*

---

## getting started

*we* are just getting started. opening the editor to the public in march 2021, this repository is going to be the public interface and change log of our development team.

*you* can simply head over to [slidenotes.io](https://editor.slidenotes.io/?tutorial=welcome) to give the editor a test drive. see how you can turn plain text into responsive web presentations, what kinds of markdown and extensive add-ons our parser interprets and how you can edit the editor itself to fit your needs.

we have provided a few live tutorials to get you started. next up is providing more helpful documentation and product information. including updates to this readme.md

## community & development

you can register an account and get access to pro features. // *see below.*

there is a very light weight privacy focused social layer integrated to the accounts and there is this repository for you to work with us, too. we are happy to answer emails to `hi [at] slidenotes.io`. we will update community guidelines and practices over time. // *see above*

## payment

there is no payment plan at the moment. instead we have created a minimalist crowd funding option where you get a few perks (animated icons!) and an account with pro privileges for a year. pitch in 100â‚¬ at at [gumroad](https://gum.co/slidenotes-support)

if you want to pay for coffee, you get an interactive PDF with an icon set designed for video conferences: [compad icons](https://gum.co/compad-cards)

## license

we are planning to use a liberal license, but it turns out choosing the right one is hard. we'll come back to this question during open beta // *see above*
